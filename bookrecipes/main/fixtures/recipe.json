Knock back the dough (punch the air out and pull the dough in on itself) then gently mould the dough into a ball. Place it on the baking parchment to prove for a further hour until doubled in size. Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7. Dust the loaf with some extra flour and cut a cross about 6cm long into the top of the loaf with a sharp knife.

Combine the flax and water and set it aside for 5 minutes to thicken. \r\nThen, whisk together the wet ingredients and the dry ingredients in separate bowls. Fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and stir until everything is well combined. The dough will be very thick!\r\nNext, itâ€™s time to chill. Pop the cookie dough in the fridge for 30 minutes, and preheat the oven to 350.\r\nWhen the dough is chilled, you can bake! Use a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop to portion out the dough and roll it into balls. Press the dough balls down gently with your hands before using a fork to give them the signature peanut butter cookie criss cross pattern. Bake the cookies on a parchment-lined baking sheet for 12 minutes. They will still be fragile at this point, so allow them to rest for 10 minutes on the baking sheet before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.\r\nFinally, eat! ðŸ™‚", "ingredients": [16, 17, 18, 19]}}]
